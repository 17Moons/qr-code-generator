hi there it's me 17Moons

open command prompt as admin and paste following commands


pip install qrcode 

pip install qrcode[pil]


after that 
you just follow the step as the program asks you

for changing the color of the custom_qr you just need to redefine the color codes

for changing the embeded image in the embed_qr is you will need to copy your image in png format
in the same folder as that of the code and write the name of your png in place of 17Moons in the code

All the best
